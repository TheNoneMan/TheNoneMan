Hi, TheNoneMan is my paraphrase of a nickname TheNobodyLolz, since everyone shortened it just to Nobody and confused each other.
This github page, however is made in hopes of one day implementing my ideas for personal projects.

- [ ] **IoT** Jigsaw puzzle sorting machine, to group pieces by color
- [ ] **IoT** Small, home-scale, storage system. I was thinking about clothes on this one, 
      so that old sweater doesn't occupy space in your wardrobe.
- [ ] **Games** Sea battle for more than 2 players. Maybe throwing in some temporary alliances and betrayal will spice up the game.
- [ ] **Graphs** Comment section, which actually shows replies to a single comment immediately below and allows to select a single thread.
